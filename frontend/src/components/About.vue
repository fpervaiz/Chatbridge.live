      Chatbridge connects you instantly to anonymous one-to-one video chats with
      other students from your university.
    </h2>
    <hr class="my-5" />
    <h3>Why does Chatbridge exist?</h3>
    <p>
      Chatbridge helps you quickly, easily and safely meet other students at
      your university.
    </p>
    <p>
      The COVID-19 pandemic stopped us all from meeting and socialising with new
      people. Chatbridge was conceived during the depths of lockdown to help
      overcome this. While originally built for University of Cambridge
      students, Chatbridge is now available to all universities and colleges.
      Get in touch to enable support for your institution!
    </p>
    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>It's really simple!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you don't have one already, create a Chatbridge account using your
        university email address. University of Cambridge students do not need
        to create an account - log in directly via Raven instead.
      </li>
      <li>
        After logging in, you'll be taken to the video chat app. You will be
        asked to grant permission to your webcam and mic, which are necessary to
        use Chatbridge.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you click 'Find me someone', we'll connect you to a video chat with
        another online user. Depending on how many other people are online, this
        can take anything from less than a second to a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        The chats are completely anonymous - no names or IDs are shared. We
        instead assign you (pretty bad) randomly generated names.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can chat for as long as you like. End the chat by hitting
        'Disconnect', or end the chat and immediately search for a new person by
        hitting 'Find me someone' again.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      You can block a user for any reason by clicking 'Block/Report' and
      completing the form. Blocking a user means you will never be connected to
      them again. And while we hope this never happens, if you come across
      anyone breaking the
      <router-link to="/rules">Community Rules</router-link>, please report them
      as well. This will help us keep bad users off the website. You can still
      block or report a user even if the chat has ended. If you have any
      screenshots or any other evidence of rule-breaking, please send them to
      <a href="mailto:admin@chatbridge.live">admin@chatbridge.live</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Is it secure?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. All sessions are encrypted. None of your chat activity on Chatbridge
      is recorded or stored, other than (for obvious reasons) the list of users
      you block or report.
    </p>
    <h3>Who can use Chatbridge?</h3>
    <p>
      Anyone with a laptop/desktop/tablet and a student email address at these
      institutions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>University of Cambridge (@cam.ac.uk)</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      We perform checks using your email address to ensure you are a student and
      not e.g. staff.
    </p>
    <h3>What about other universities?</h3>
    <p>
      We can make Chatbridge available to your university or college! Please get
      in touch at
      <a href="mailto:admin@chatbridge.live">admin@chatbridge.live</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Who runs Chatbridge?</h3>
    <p>
      Chatbridge was built and is maintained by an engineering student at
      Cambridge. The project is growing and volunteers are very welcome.
    </p>
    <h3>Can I contribute?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes! There are plenty of features still to add and improvements still to
      make. Please get in touch at
      <a href="mailto:admin@chatbridge.live">admin@chatbridge.live</a>.
